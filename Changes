	* AnyWhere.pm (AUTOLOAD): Removed possibilty to use AutoLoader in
	classes communicating over network. User complained that using
	AutoLoading made debugging much harder. 

	* Factory.pm (new): changed API to use named parameters. Old API
	is still suported (although obsolete)
	(new): tk_top parameter is optional. So user can use its own event
	loop. *Using TK control loop is no longer mandatory*
	(DESTROY): new method to clean up socket during destruction.
	(getSocket): new method to get the socket created by factory. This
	socket must be used in user event loop when Tk is not used.

        - better $VERSION handling
        - some more explanation on interaction with AutoLoader (in AnyLocal
        man page).

0.4 97/12/31
        - added RPC_SUB arrays to avoid infinite loop between local and 
        remote when a function is unknown.
        - remote the 'callback' string. Now when the first parameter is a
        subroutine reference, Agent store the reference and the subroutine
        will be called when the remote call is over.

0.3 97/12/2
        - Simplified AnyRemote. Fixed some bugs, better tests
 
0.2 97/11/5
        - Fixed problem with directory layout. It should install properly
        with make install.
