        * Server.pm (writeSock): Added an eval around the socket
        send call.  If the client disconnects before we send then
        we were dying.

        * Server.pm (new): Added two optional arguments (socket, and
        manual_accept) in that order.  These arguments can be used to 
        disable the accept, and to use the socket that is passed in.

        * Server.pm (goodGuy): Fixed a bug when specifying host names
        and not IP addresses, we called gethostbyname expecting it to
        return the ip address, but we need to unpack the raw address.

        * Agent.pm (destroy): Fixed a circular reference in agent to
        the factory object and the client object.

        * Factory.pm (readSock): Changed readSock, we no longer close
        the socket within readSock, we allow DESTROY to do this.  We
        were getting a warning from DESTROY because it was trying to
        close the socket, and it had already been closed.

        * ObjectHandle.pm (new): Changed the way ObjectHandler loads
        the remote class.  We now allow our remote class to be in a
        namespace like: 'Some::Object'.  We still allow a file name
        to be passed in (ie. Object.pm).

        * Removed the dependancy on Tk, this package is no longer 
        needed or required.  The test cases have been rewritten
        without using Tk.

	* AnyWhere.pm (AUTOLOAD): Removed possibilty to use AutoLoader in
	classes communicating over network. User complained that using
	AutoLoading made debugging much harder. 

	* Factory.pm (new): changed API to use named parameters. Old API
	is still suported (although obsolete)
	(new): tk_top parameter is optional. So user can use its own event
	loop. *Using TK control loop is no longer mandatory*
	(DESTROY): new method to clean up socket during destruction.
	(getSocket): new method to get the socket created by factory. This
	socket must be used in user event loop when Tk is not used.


0.5 98/2/17
        - better $VERSION handling
        - some more explanation on interaction with AutoLoader (in AnyLocal
        man page).

0.4 97/12/31
        - added RPC_SUB arrays to avoid infinite loop between local and 
        remote when a function is unknown.
        - remote the 'callback' string. Now when the first parameter is a
        subroutine reference, Agent store the reference and the subroutine
        will be called when the remote call is over.

0.3 97/12/2
        - Simplified AnyRemote. Fixed some bugs, better tests
 
0.2 97/11/5
        - Fixed problem with directory layout. It should install properly
        with make install.
